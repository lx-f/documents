documents
=========

Welcome to the documents section of [my website][1]! This is where I write about something -- I don't know what I'll write
about but it's mostly the daily happenings of my life.

To write something interesting, I decided to challenge myself and write about it by explaining what it is, why I am doing it
and what I did next to make something happen.

I separated the website and this section because I didn't want to get distracted of typing a lot of HTML code just to design
a portion of the document.

I'll be separating the type of the document by _genre_ (e.g. computing, mathematics, literature, etc...) to make the topics
organized. The documents are separated by a code. (COMP-001, MATH-001, LIT-001, etc...)
